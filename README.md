# Airbnb Database Optimization

This repository focuses on optimizing the Airbnb database to enhance performance, data integrity, and analytics capabilities for different departments within the organization. As part of the ongoing restructuring process, we aim to address the identified issues and improve the overall data modeling.

## Identified Issues
The previous data modeling approach suffered from several issues, including:

1. **Data Centralization**: All data related to Airbnb listings is stored in a single document, causing slow query performance.
2. **Lack of Experience in Patterns**: The previous team lacked experience in applying patterns, which can significantly improve performance and data modeling.
3. **Missing Indexes**: Indexes have not been applied to optimize query performance.
4. **Review Overwriting**: Due to the growing number of reviews, the existing approach involves overwriting them regularly, hindering comprehensive analysis over time.
5. **Data Collection Mistakes**: Mistakes in data collection, such as duplicate entries and incorrect timestamps, need to be addressed.

## Approach and Optimization Steps
To optimize the Airbnb database, we will follow these steps:

### 1. Data Modeling Optimization

- **Slide 1**: Identify the most typical use case of showing property listing information to customers. Optimize the document schema for this use case, considering the information that should be returned in a typical query. For example, provide a sample of reviews rather than all reviews, exclude past transaction data, and focus on relevant details. This may involve creating new collections and documents.
  
### 2. Data Cleaning and Error Resolution

- **Slide 2**: Review the data for any errors, such as inconsistent transactions or inappropriate duplication. Clean up the data by removing or correcting these inconsistencies to improve data quality and reliability.

### 3. Departmental Analytics and Query Optimization

- **Slide 3**: Address a set of specific questions from different departments, ranging from standard to advanced difficulty. Optimize the database schema and queries for each use case, considering factors like query frequency, read/write load, and performance optimization techniques. Apply appropriate patterns, embedding, linking, and indexing strategies to improve query speed and relevancy of returned data.

### 4. Database Updates

- **Slides 13-15**: Implement fictional database updates, such as adding new properties, reviews, and review metrics. Ensure data consistency, prevent staleness, and validate that the average scores across all metrics are correctly calculated for listings.

## Repository Structure and Usage

This repository is structured as follows:

- `data_modeling_optimization/`: Contains code and documentation related to the data modeling optimization process.
- `data_cleaning/`: Provides scripts and instructions for cleaning up data and resolving errors.
- `departmental_analytics/`: Includes queries and optimizations for different departments' analytics requirements.
- `database_updates/`: Offers examples and guidelines for performing database updates while maintaining data freshness and integrity.


## Conclusion

By applying data modeling optimization techniques, cleaning up the data, and addressing specific analytics use cases, we can enhance the performance and efficiency of the Airbnb database. These optimizations will benefit different departments within the organization by providing accurate, relevant, and up-to-date information for their analytical needs.
